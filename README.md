# Color-Runner
In this game you attempt to collect coins in an endless runner fashion. You are allowed 2 jumps, you can reset your jump counter by
landing on the ground, or passing through a wall. In order to pass through a wall, you need to have your indicator in the upper
left of the screen the same color as the wall as you plan to pass through. If you do not have the colors aligned, you will lose.
